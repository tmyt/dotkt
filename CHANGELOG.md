# Changelog

All notable changes to DotKt (Kotlin → .NET/CLR). Package versions carry the embedded
Kotlin compiler version as SemVer build metadata (e.g. `0.9.1+kotlin-2.2.0`).

## 0.9.2 — unreleased

Interop/primitive bug fixes found after 0.9.1 shipped.

### Fixed
- **Signed `Byte` / `Short`** as parameters, locals, fields, and constant args threw
  `InvalidProgramException` (or crashed ilemit). They were omitted from the primitive
  paths (Int/Long/unsigned were present): `birType` fell to the user-type fallback
  `@Byte`/`@Short`, and ilemit `EmitConst` had no `byte`/`short` case so a `const byte`
  pushed `null`. Kotlin `Byte` = signed `sbyte`, `Short` = `Int16` (UByte stays
  unsigned). Fixes `MemoryStream().WriteByte(65)` too. (`il-bytearg`)
- **Lambda passed to a .NET constructor's delegate parameter** (`new Thread({ … })`)
  crashed ilemit with a `NullReferenceException` (`EmitClrNew`): the façade erases the
  delegate param, so the exact-type ctor lookup found nothing. `EmitClrNew` now selects
  the ctor by arity (preferring delegate-param/lambda-arity matches) and builds the
  specific delegate. (`il-delegatearg`)
- **`for (x in <.NET IEnumerable<T>>)`** over a raw .NET enumerable (not a Kotlin
  collection) failed to compile: `iterator()` was ambiguous (only the clashing stdlib
  extension `iterator()`s applied). facadegen now injects a frontend-only
  `operator fun iterator(): Iterator<T>` for any type implementing `IEnumerable<T>`;
  the backend bypasses it and enumerates via GetEnumerator/MoveNext/Current
  (forEachInline). (`il-netenum`)
- **User class implementing Kotlin `Iterable<T>`** (`class R : Iterable<T>`) crashed
  ilemit (`KeyNotFoundException 'Iterable'`): `Iterator<T>` had a monomorphized
  synthetic interface but `Iterable<T>` did not. Added `KIterable_<elem>`
  (`operator fun iterator(): KIterator_<elem>`), parallel to the existing
  `KIterator_<elem>`; both the `for` loop and explicit `.iterator()` now work. (`il-iterable`)
- **User class implementing/extending a .NET-mapped Kotlin stdlib supertype** crashed
  ilemit (`KeyNotFound`) — the supertype emission didn't route these through their
  .NET mapping. A whole cluster:
  - **Custom exceptions** `class E(msg) : Exception(msg)` / `RuntimeException` -> a CLR
    class `: System.Exception` (ctor chains to `System.Exception(string)`, `.message`/
    `.cause` -> `.Message`/`.InnerException`, catchable by base type). (`il-customexc`)
  - **`Comparator<T>`** -> `IComparer<T>` (`compare` -> `Compare`). (`il-comparator`)
  - **`AutoCloseable`/`Closeable`** -> `IDisposable` (`close` -> `Dispose`).
  Mechanism: supertype base/interface emission now routes through `birType` when it
  maps to a `clr:`/`clrg:` spec; `clrIfaceMemberName` renames the overridden members;
  the `catch` clause types via `birType` (a user exception catches as its own type, not
  `object`); `MapType` resolves bare .NET FQNs. (Comparable<T> as a self-referential
  generic supertype is now handled too — see below.)
- **`use {}`** (Closeable/AutoCloseable) now lowers to `try { block(it) } finally { close()/Dispose() }`
  returning the block value — the CLR analogue of C# `using`. (`il-use`)
- **`Comparable<T>`** (`class V : Comparable<V>`) — the self-referential generic interface
  `IComparable<V>` (V the emitted type) made ilemit call `.GetMethods()` on a
  TypeBuilderInstantiation (throws). Interface-impl linking now enumerates the OPEN
  generic definition and re-anchors each method via `TypeBuilder.GetMethod` (same
  pattern as the self-ref base ctor). `<`/`>`/`<=`/`compareTo`/`sorted()` all work. (`il-comparable`)

## 0.9.1 — 2026-06-23

Language/stdlib long-tail completion + a type-emission correctness refactor. The
direct-IL backend, coroutine surface, generics, and forward interop were already
complete in 0.9.0; this release closes the remaining A (language) / B (stdlib) gaps
so the A/B checklists in `docs/remaining-tasks.md` have **zero** open items.

### Added
- **Regex `matches` / `find`** — full-input match + `MatchResult?` (via `DotKt.Text.Regexes`
  shims), `MatchResult.value` → `Match.Value`. (`il-regex`)
- **`return` as an expression** — `val x = if (c) a else return b` (new `returnExpr`
  lowering, `tryStack`-aware). (`il-langtail`)
- **enum per-entry bodies** — `enum class Op { PLUS { override fun apply(…)=… }; abstract
  fun apply(…) }`: the base enum becomes abstract and each body entry is emitted as a
  subclass `<>Enum_NAME : Enum`. (`il-enumbody`)
- **Field-level visibility** — a property's visibility is honored on its backing field:
  `private` → true `FieldAttributes.Private`, `internal` → `Assembly`, `protected` →
  `FamORAssem`. (`il-fieldvis`)

### Changed
- **Inner / nested classes are now emitted as true CLR nested types** (`Outer+Inner`)
  instead of being flattened to separate top-level types. Nested types retain Kotlin's
  legal access to the enclosing type's `private` members, which is what makes true
  `private` field visibility correct. `inner` classes still capture `__outer`.

### Fixed
- **Compound-condition smart-cast** — `if (x is Int && x > 10)` no longer mis-takes the
  then-branch (the `>` operand stayed boxed as `Any`); `bin` now coerces a boxed operand
  to the other operand's primitive type, and `IrGetValue` honors a narrowed smart-cast.

### Notes
- Verified working & locked by samples this release: `lateinit` (uninitialized read
  throws), `field` in custom accessors, `when`+type smart-cast.
- Full IL suite green + JVM differential ALL MATCH + ilverify-clean.
- Known residue (unchanged, tracked in `docs/remaining-tasks.md` §F / §R): packaged-SDK
  end-to-end consumption still has MSBuild SDK-resolution plumbing to finish (F-308);
  reverse-interop cosmetic naming/`[Nullable]` is gated behind R-1.

## 0.9.0

Initial pre-1.0 line: direct-IL backend (C# codegen retired), CLR-native coroutines
(`suspend` ⇔ `Task<T>` / `IAsyncEnumerable`), user generics, forward .NET interop
(import-driven, façade-free), and the 3-package distribution (Sdk / Toolchain / Runtime
+ Templates).
