# Changelog

All notable changes to DotKt (Kotlin → .NET/CLR). Package versions carry the embedded
Kotlin compiler version as SemVer build metadata (e.g. `0.9.1+kotlin-2.2.0`).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **kotc ([tmyt/dotkt#87], area:kotc/area:bir2cir): an INHERITED member `inline fun` with a lambda arg now splices.**
  A member `inline fun` called through a SUBCLASS receiver — e.g. kotlinx.coroutines
  `ConcurrentLinkedListNode<N>.nextOrIfClosed`, a non-local-return-lambda inline fn invoked on a `Segment<S : Segment<S>>`
  — resolves in IR to a FAKE OVERRIDE whose `parent` is the subclass and whose `body` is `null`. kotc's inline-call
  emitter (`emitOwnerfulInlineNode`) took the `callInline` `owner` from `callee.parent` verbatim, so it named the
  SUBCLASS; but bir2cir's InlineSplice keys the `[KotlinInline]` payload under the REAL declaring class (`InlineBirStash`),
  so the lookup missed and the port build broke with `bir2cir: inline splice: cannot splice
  kotlinx.coroutines.internal.Segment.nextOrIfClosed (pc=1 ga=0): no [KotlinInline] payload found`. A fake override also
  has a `null` body, so the same-module splice-routing gate (`callee.body != null`) misrouted the call to the cross-module
  path. Now kotc resolves the fake override (`resolveFakeOverride`, the same normalization the ordinary member-call owner
  path already did at three sites but the inline path had omitted) for the callInline owner + all declaration facts, and
  routes the splice on the resolved declaration's body. The port now advances past bir2cir InlineSplice into the
  suspend-lowering + ilemit stages. Gate: `cases/il-inlineinherit` (a member inline fn with a non-local-return lambda,
  inherited through both a plain subclass and a self-bounded generic `Seg<S : Seg<S>>`, spliced at the subclass call site).

- **bir2cir ([tmyt/dotkt#78], area:bir2cir): a suspend call INSIDE a catch handler now lowers (catch-hoist).**
  Resuming into a CLR `catch` clause is illegal IL, so `SuspendColdLowering` used to refuse any suspend fun with a
  suspension in a catch/finally handler (`SuspensionsSupported`'s `inHandler` gate) — and, because the cold-entry ABI is
  coupled to body transformability, ONE such refusal (`SelectImplementation.processResultAndInvokeBlockRecoveringException`,
  a `catch (e) { recoverAndThrow(e) }`, kotlinx `Select.kt:723`) cascaded to the entire `select` family. bir2cir's new
  `HoistSuspendingCatches` (`toolchain/bir2cir/SuspendColdLowering.Normalize.cs`) lifts a suspending catch handler OUT of
  the CLR clause: the real catch only records the exception into an SM-field-backed capture, and the handler body runs as
  gated straight-line code (`if (__exc$N != null) { … }`) after the try, where the state machine segments its suspension
  normally. Finally-free trys only (hoisting past a finally would flip Kotlin's run-after-handler ordering). Gated in
  lockstep in `SuspensionsSupported`. Also fixes a pre-existing latent bug the newly-lowered value-returning try/catch
  exposed: an init-less value-type SM `var` (kotc's `tryExpr` value var) emitted a null-Int32 const; it now default-inits.

- **bir2cir ([tmyt/dotkt#80], area:bir2cir): `COROUTINE_SUSPENDED` intrinsic reads resolve everywhere.** The top-level
  val `kotlin.coroutines.intrinsics.COROUTINE_SUSPENDED` was mis-owned by `MemberCallSubstitution` to the ENCLOSING file
  class (it is a val, absent from the top-level-fun index), so a bare `<FileClass>.get_COROUTINE_SUSPENDED` reached ilemit
  unresolved. Now bound to the canonical `IntrinsicsKt` owner at substitution time — covering EVERY reader, including the
  port's NON-suspend readers (`getResult(): Any?` in `CancellableContinuationImpl`/`Builders`) that never reach the SM
  transform. The former F2-only `SubstBlock` canonicalization is lifted into `Rewrite`/`RewriteNoSpill` so every SM-body
  path (incl. a direct user `suspendCoroutineUninterceptedOrReturn { … COROUTINE_SUSPENDED }`) normalizes to the SM's own
  `Suspended()` marker.

- **bir2cir ([tmyt/dotkt#82], area:bir2cir): a structured collection loop whose body spans a suspension now lowers
  (loop-flatten).** A `forArray` (`for (x in array)`) or `forEachInline` (inline `Iterable.forEach`) loop whose body
  contains a suspension carries implicit loop machinery (array + index; or an IEnumerator) and an element local that cross
  the resume point — but the straight-line SM cannot segment a structured loop, so a splice-generated element local
  reached ilemit as `load unknown var __inlsN$element`. bir2cir's new `FlattenSuspendingLoops`
  (`toolchain/bir2cir/SuspendColdLowering.Normalize.cs`) desugars such a loop to flat `label`/`brIf`/`goto` CFG with its
  loop temps made explicit `{k:var}`, so `CollectVarFields` spills them into SM fields and the resume re-enters across the
  back-edge. `forEachInline` uses a NON-generic `IEnumerator` (unconditional `viaNonGeneric`) so an open generic-param
  element never mints a broken `IEnumerable<!!T>` TypeBuilder token. A post-Build tripwire (`AssertLocalsResolved`) now
  converts any residual unspilled SM local into a loud bir2cir error instead of a distant ilemit `load unknown var`.
